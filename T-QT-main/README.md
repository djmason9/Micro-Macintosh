# Micro Macintosh
This is the smallest macintosh computer simulator I could make. It does not run any machintosh software but rather displays a series of Mac OS 7 screens. It can be upgraded to add more screens or pretty much anything you want.

It uses the Lilygo T-QT-Pro Microprocessor with a 128x128 pixel 0.85 inch full color screen. T-QT-Pro is a development board. It can work independently. It consists of ESP32-S3 MCU supporting Wi-Fi + BLE communication protocol and motherboard PCB. The screen is 0.85 inch IPS LCD GC9107. At the core of this module is the ESP32S3 chip. ESP32-S3 integrates Wi-Fi (2.4 GHz band) and Bluetooth 5.0(LE) solutions on a single chip.

# Case Build
This case was 3D printed on a Bambu Labs X1 Carbon using a cool plate with a PolyTerra PLA filament preset settings. I added all top surface ironing, and manual tree support. A 5mm outter brim only with a 0.1 gap
